I want to build a simple educational web game for children aged 6–13 in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf, called "روّاد القيم" (Ruwwad Al-Qiyam).

Requirements:

- The game language: Arabic (RTL).
- The interface must be colorful, child-friendly, and culturally appropriate, using these colors:

  - Background gradient: from light olive green (#A3C293) to Saudi green (#007A33).
  - Text color: white (#FFFFFF) and dark gray (#2E2E2E).
  - Buttons: warm golden yellow (#FFD369) with orange highlight (#FFA726) on hover.
  - Stars and rewards: shiny gold (#FFC107) with subtle glow.
  
- Font: Use Arabic-friendly font like "Cairo".
- The game must be responsive and playable on mobiles, tablets, and web browsers.
- Include a star counter visible at the top right.

Game Sections (each as a button on main menu):

1. ⭐ "عمل خيري": Clicking shows a simple good deed scenario (like "ابتسمت لأخيك الصغير") and awards a star with a cheerful animation and sound.

2. 📚 "أحاديث نبوية": Display 3 short hadiths with kid-friendly explanations, followed by multiple-choice questions. Correct answers earn stars and sound feedback.

3. 🧩 "مغامرات القيم": Interactive moral stories with choices (e.g., "رأيت زميلك يقع، ماذا تفعل؟"). Player earns stars based on correct moral choices reflecting the Prophet’s teachings.

4. 🕋 "ركن المسجد": Teach kids wudu steps with fun instructions, mosque etiquette, and allow them to listen and repeat the adhan. Earn stars for correct steps.

Extras:

- Add sound effects on button clicks, correct answers, and star rewards.
- Background changes by time of day (light blue morning to darker green evening).
- Use animations for stars and feedback messages like "أحسنت!" or "يا بطل!" in Arabic.
- Include a button to enable sounds on mobile devices.
- Keep the code simple, modular, and easy to expand later.

Please generate the full HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files with the above specifications, including placeholders for sounds and text content so I can edit and expand easily.

Use modern, clean, readable code.
